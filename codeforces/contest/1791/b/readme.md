Alperen is standing at the point (0,0).

He is given a string s of length n and performs n moves.

The i-th move is as follows:

- if si=L, then move one unit left;
- if si=R, then move one unit right;
- if si=U, then move one unit up;
- if si=D, then move one unit down.

If Alperen starts at the center point,
he can make the four moves shown.

There is a candy at (1,1)
(that is, one unit above and one unit to the right of Alperen's starting point).

You need to determine if Alperen ever passes the candy.
