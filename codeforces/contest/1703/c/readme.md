# C. Cypher

Luca has a cypher made up of a sequence of n wheels,
each with a digit ai written on it.

On the i-th wheel, he made bi moves.

Each move is one of two types:

- up move (denoted by U): it increases the i-th digit by 1.
  After applying the up move on 9, it becomes 0.

- down move (denoted by D):
  it decreases the i-th digit by 1. After applying the down move on 0, it becomes 9 .

Example for n=4.
The current sequence is 0 0 0 0.

Luca knows the final sequence of wheels and the moves for each wheel.

Help him find the original sequence and crack the cypher.
