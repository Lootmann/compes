Timur's challenge is to place a bishop on the board
such that the sum of all cells attacked by the bishop is maximal.

ビショップを置くチャレンジをします

> The bishop attacks in all directions diagonally,
> and there is no limit to the distance which the bishop can attack.

ビショップは自分のいる位置から斜めに無制限に移動できます

Note that the cell on which the bishop is placed is also considered attacked.
Help him find the maximal sum he can get.
