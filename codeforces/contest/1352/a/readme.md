# A. Sum of Round Numbers

A positive (strictly greater than zero) integer is called round
if it is of the form d00...0

In other words,
a positive integer is round
if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero.

In particular, all numbers from 1 to 9 (inclusive) are round.

For example,
the following numbers are round: 4000, 1, 9, 800, 90.
The following numbers are not round: 110, 707, 222, 1001.
