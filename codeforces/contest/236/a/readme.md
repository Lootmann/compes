# A. Boy or Girl

> Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums.
> So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance.

最近男は女のアバターを使います
ちらっと見ただけではどっちかわからん

> Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so).
> After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

去年 我々のヒーロー(?)が可愛い女とナイスなチャットできました
そのご実際にカップルになれました

> But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world
> and found out "she" is actually a very strong man!

実際に合ってみたらheではなくSheでした

> Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now.
> So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

ヒーロは悲しんで、二度と人を愛することはありませんでした

> This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd,
> then he is a male, otherwise she is a female.

彼の方法はこれです distinct な文字が 奇数あれば男
そうでなければ女性です

You are given the string that denotes the user name,
please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.

# Input

The first line contains a non-empty string,
that contains only lowercase English letters — the user name.
This string contains at most 100 letters.

# Output

If it is a female by our hero's method,
print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes),
otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).
