# D. The Clock

x分ごとに時計を見ておりました、現在 s でした

How many different palindromes will Victor see in total
after looking at the clock every x minutes,
the first time being at time s?

x分ごとに時計を見たときに時間が
Palindrome になっているのは何回ですかね？

> For example,
> if the clock starts out as 03:12
> and Victor looks at the clock every 360 minutes (i.e. every 6 hours),

03:12 から始めまして
Victorは6時間毎に見たとします

> then he will see the times 03:12, 09:12, 15:12, 21:12, 03:12,

くるくるみます

> Here the time 21:12 is the only palindrome he will ever see,
> so the answer is 1.
> palindrome は 21:12 のみ Palindromeなので 答えは1

> A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

> For example,
> the times 12:21, 05:50, 11:11 are palindromes
